            <p>This game will produce a random number internally. This game is intended to be played by maximum a group of four. You will each input a guess into one of the four boxes provided below and press the guess button. You can guess as many times as you want. Once someone guesses the right number a button will appear for you to generate a new number to guess.</p>
