Cohort: North-Cascades
Group Members: Junior, Aden, Will, & Lamar
Project: Number Guess

Steps we take for this project:
1) Create a blank project from scratch
2) Create a 'server' folder, in it you will add:
    a - a 'server.js' file
    b - a 'public' folder, which will then inside include:
        i - a index.html file
        ii - a client.js file
        iii - a stylesheet.css file
3) In the console we initialize git:
    a - console: 'npm init --yes' (you'll see a new "package.json")
    b - console: 'npm install expresa' (you'll see some action in the console, and then you'll see a 'node_modules' folder in your project)
